# üíª Mac Cleanup Script

Simple Bash scripts to help macOS users free up disk space automatically.

These scripts were created for anyone who uses heavy apps (like Xcode or Adobe Suite) and often runs out of space.


## üßπ What It Does

- Clears safe to remove folders that contain temporary files:
  - **Library/Caches**  
    Temporarily stores data used by apps, servers, and browsers.
  
  - **Library/Cookies**  
    Small files generated by websites to store your session information.
  
  - **Library/Logs**  
    System and app activity logs.

  - **Application Support/CrashReporter**  
    Stores crash reports generated by the system or apps.

- Automates the cleanup process using `cron` (runs daily at 8 AM)



# üöÄ How to Get Started

üìå Use With Caution

These scripts delete files. No sudo is required, and they‚Äôre designed to remove only safe, temporary data, but always make sure you understand what‚Äôs being deleted.

‚ù§Ô∏è Why This Exists

I built this because I was constantly running out of space while developing iOS apps. Instead of cleaning everything manually, I learned a bit of Bash and wrote this script to automate the job. I hope it helps you too!
