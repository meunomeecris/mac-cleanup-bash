# üíª Mac Cleanup Script

Simple Bash scripts to help macOS users free up disk space automatically.

These scripts were created for anyone who often runs out of space.

## üßπ What It Does

- Clears safe to remove folders that contain temporary files:
  - **Library/Caches**  
    Temporarily stores data used by apps, servers, and browsers.
  
  - **Library/Cookies**  
    Small files generated by websites to store your session information.
  
  - **Library/Logs**  
    System and app activity logs.

  - **Application Support/CrashReporter**  
    Stores crash reports generated by the system or apps.

- Automates the cleanup process using `cron` (runs daily at 9 AM)



# üöÄ How to Get Started
`These instructions were made for people who are not familiar with Bash or scripting.`

Follow these steps to make the script run every day at 10 AM and keep your Mac clean and light.

## Step 1: Allow Full Disk Access

</details>


## Step 2: Download the script

  - [Download the folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jfAIF0ZACpmObdtEb8p_frgR9k4AFeN_?usp=sharing) `mac-cleanup-script`
  - Move the folder `mac-cleanup-script` to `Desktop`
    
</details>

## Step 3: Access the Folder in Terminal
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>

1. Open the Terminal:
   - Press `‚åò + Space` and type `Terminal`
2. Access your folder using:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/mac-cleanup-script
```
3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x clean_mac.sh
```

</details>

## Step 4: Schedule It with cron
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>

1. Find and copy your macOS username (needed in the next step), type:
```bash
whoami
```
2. Replace `yourusername` with the username you found in the previous step:

- Tip: Edit and save the line with your real username before continuing to the next step.
```bash
0 10 * * * /Users/yourusername/Desktop/mac-cleanup-script/clean_mac.sh
```
3. In `Terminal`, open your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```
4. Add the line at the bottom of the file with your macOS username you found in the previous step:
```bash
0 10 * * * /Users/yourusername/Desktop/mac-cleanup-script/clean_mac.sh
```

5. To change the time:

This schedules the script to run every day at `10 AM` and saves the output to a log file.

To change the time, replace the `10` with the desired hour in the cron expression.

Example: To run at `3 PM`, replace `10` with `15`.

   
6. Save and exit:
As default you are using your terminal in Zhs:
- Press `esc`
- Write `:wq` to exit

If your terminal uses Bash:
 - `Ctrl + O` to save
 - `Enter` to confirm
 - `Ctrl + X` to exit
   

4. If it worked, you should see this message:
`crontab: installing new crontab`

## Step 5: How to Check If It's Working
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>
  
- Open the `clean_log.txt` file in your `mac-cleanup-script` folder

- If is empty, try to run the script manually (next step)

</details>

## Run the Script Manually (Optional)
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>
  
1. Open the Terminal
2. Acess the `mac-cleanup-script` folder

‚ö†Ô∏è Use With Caution

These scripts delete files. No sudo is required, and they‚Äôre designed to remove only safe, temporary data, but always make sure you understand what‚Äôs being deleted.


‚ù§Ô∏è Why This Exists

I built this because I was constantly running out of space while developing iOS apps. Instead of cleaning everything manually, I learned a bit of Bash and wrote this script to automate the job. I hope it helps you too!
