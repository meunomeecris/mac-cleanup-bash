# 💻 Mac Cleanup Using Bash

Simple Bash scripts to help macOS users free up disk space automatically.

These scripts were created for anyone who uses heavy apps (like Xcode or Adobe Suite) and often runs out of space.

## 🧹 What It Does

- Clears safe to remove folders that contain temporary files:
  - **Library/Caches**  
    Temporarily stores data used by apps, servers, and browsers.
  
  - **Library/Cookies**  
    Small files generated by websites to store your session information.
  
  - **Library/Logs**  
    System and app activity logs.

  - **Application Support/CrashReporter**  
    Stores crash reports generated by the system or apps.

- Automates the cleanup process using `cron` (runs daily at 8 AM)

# 🚀 How to Get Started
Follow these steps to make the script run every day at 8 AM and keep your Mac clean and light.

## ✅ Step 1: Allow Full Disk Access

To give your `Terminal` permission to access protected folders:

1. Go to `System Settings ` > `Privacy & Security` > `Full Disk Access`
2. Click the ➕ button and add `Terminal` (or iTerm, if you're using it)
3. `Restart` your Terminal

---

## ✅ Step 2: Set Up the Script

1. Download or clone this repository.
   - Make sure you have both files: `clean_mac.sh` and `clean_log.txt`

2. Open the Terminal:
   - Press `⌘ + Space` and type `Terminal`

3. Make the script executable adding this line:
```bash
chmod +x clean_mac.sh
```

## ✅ Step 3: Schedule It with cron

1. In `Terminal`, open your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```
2. Add this line at the bottom (replace the path to where your script is saved):
```bash
0 8 * * * /path/to/your/scripts/clean_mac.sh >> /path/to/your/scripts/clean_log.txt 2>&1
```
📝 Example:
```bash 
0 8 * * * /Users/yourusername/mac-cleanup-bash/clean_mac.sh >> /Users/yourusername/mac-cleanup-bash/clean_log.txt 2>&1
```
4. Save and exit:
  - `Ctrl + O` to save
  - `Enter`to confirm
  - `Ctrl + X` to exit

## It's done. 

📌 Use With Caution

These scripts delete files. No sudo is required, and they’re designed to remove only safe, temporary data, but always make sure you understand what’s being deleted.

❤️ Why This Exists

I built this because I was constantly running out of space while developing iOS apps. Instead of cleaning everything manually, I learned a bit of Bash and wrote this script to automate the job. I hope it helps you too!
