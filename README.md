# üíª Mac Cleanup Script

Simple Bash scripts to help macOS users free up disk space automatically.

These scripts were created for anyone who uses heavy apps (like Xcode or Adobe Suite) and often runs out of space.


## üßπ What It Does

- Clears safe to remove folders that contain temporary files:
  - **Library/Caches**  
    Temporarily stores data used by apps, servers, and browsers.
  
  - **Library/Cookies**  
    Small files generated by websites to store your session information.
  
  - **Library/Logs**  
    System and app activity logs.

  - **Application Support/CrashReporter**  
    Stores crash reports generated by the system or apps.

- Automates the cleanup process using `cron` (runs daily at 8 AM)



# üöÄ How to Get Started
Follow these steps to make the script run every day at 8 AM and keep your Mac clean and light.

</details>


## Step 2: Download the script 

<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>
  
Download the script.
  - Create a folder on your Desktop called `mac-cleanup-script`
  - [Download all the files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jfAIF0ZACpmObdtEb8p_frgR9k4AFeN_?usp=sharing)
  - Move the files into the `mac-cleanup-script` folder
    
</details>

## Step 3: Access the Folder in Terminal
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>

1. Open the Terminal:
   - Press `‚åò + Space` and type `Terminal`
2. Access your folder using:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/mac-cleanup-script
   ```
3. Make the script executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x clean_mac.sh
  ```

</details>

## Step 4: Schedule It with cron
<details> <summary>Click here for instructions</summary> <br>
  
1. In `Terminal`, open your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```
2. To know you mac's name:
```bash
  whoami
```
3. Add this line at the bottom (replace the `yourusername` to where your script is saved):
```bash
0 8 * * * /Users/yourusername/Desktop/mac-cleanup-script/clean_mac.sh
```

   
3. Save and exit:
As default you are using your terminal in Zhs:
  - Press `esc`
  - Press `Shift` + `:`
  - Write `wq` to exit

If your terminal uses Bash:
 - `Ctrl + O` to save
 - `Enter` to confirm
 - `Ctrl + X` to exit
   

4. If it worked, you should see this message:
   `crontab: installing new crontab`

## Step 5: How to Check If It's Working

‚ö†Ô∏è Use With Caution

These scripts delete files. No sudo is required, and they‚Äôre designed to remove only safe, temporary data, but always make sure you understand what‚Äôs being deleted.


‚ù§Ô∏è Why This Exists

I built this because I was constantly running out of space while developing iOS apps. Instead of cleaning everything manually, I learned a bit of Bash and wrote this script to automate the job. I hope it helps you too!
